# Myntra Clone

This is a front-end clone of the popular fashion e-commerce platform **Myntra**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the user interface and basic functionalities of an online shopping platform.

## Overview
This project is a simple, static website designed to mimic the Myntra platform. It includes a homepage, product listing page, and basic shopping cart functionalities. The goal of this project is to practice front-end web development skills, including responsiveness and interactivity using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes, offering a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Product Listings**: Users can browse products by category.
- **Product Detail Page**: View detailed information about a product, including images and pricing.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to the cart, view the cart, and remove items.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for products by name (if implemented).
- **Static Frontend**: This project does not include backend integration, so no payment or user authentication is implemented.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
